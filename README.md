# Human Pose Estimation - Evaluating Tennis Swings

### Roadmap

- Create baseline joint recognition
- Calculate critical angles (knees, shoulders, elbows)
- Recognize swing motion
- Determine what statistics are interesting (knees bent during swing, swing speed, hip torque)
- Streamline to dashboard for visualization (AWS)
