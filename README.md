# Human Pose Estimation - Evaluating Tennis Swings

### Roadmap

- [x] Create baseline joint recognition
- [x] Calculate critical angles (knees, shoulders, elbows)
- [ ] Recognize swing motion
- [ ] Determine what statistics are interesting (knees bent during swing, swing speed, hip torque)
- [ ] Streamline to dashboard for visualization (AWS)
